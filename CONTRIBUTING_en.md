## Code of Conduct

* Ebookchain is maintained by volunteers. We are committed to providing 
  a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, Whether you're a 
  regular contributor or a newcomer.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every
  design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous
  costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
  ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone. That is not welcome behavior. Private harassment is also 
  unacceptable. 
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other
  attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
* Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or
  documentation. There is no need to address persons when explaining
  code (e.g. "When the developer").  
* No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being 
  harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact
  us with a capture (log, photo, email) of the harassment if possible. 

## Getting help

When you get a question, please find the answers from the follow resources firstly.

Documents, releases, marketing information are on [Dev blog][]

Community discussion, questions, and informal bug reporting are done on the
[forum of Ebookchain][].

## Submitting bug reports

Before reporting a bug, read these pointers.

**Note:** The issue tracker is for *bugs*, not requests for help. The preferred 
way to report bugs is to use the GitHub issue tracker, for example, [Ebookcoin 
issue tracker][], [Official site of Ebookchain][].Questions should be asked on the
[forum of Ebookchain][] instead.

### Reporting bugs effectively

- When opening new issues or commenting on existing issues on Ebookchain
  please make sure discussions are related to concrete technical issues with the
  Ebookchain software.

- Include information about **the browser and the operating system in which 
  the problem occurred**. 

- Mention which release of Ebookchain you're using. Preferably, try also with
  the current development snapshot, to ensure the problem has not already been
  fixed.

- Mention very precisely what went wrong. "X is broken" is not a good bug
  report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Describe the
  exact steps a maintainer has to take to make the problem occur. We can not
  fix something that we can not observe.

- If the problem can not be reproduced in any of the demos included in the
  Ebookchain distribution, please provide a document that demonstrates the 
  problem.
