## Code of Conduct

* Ebookchain is maintained by volunteers. We are committed to providing 
  a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, Whether you're a 
  regular contributor or a newcomer.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that some individuals and cultures consider the casual use of
  profanity offensive and off-putting.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every
  design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous
  costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
  ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone. That is not welcome behavior. Private harassment is also 
  unacceptable. 
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other
  attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
* Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or
  documentation. There is no need to address persons when explaining
  code (e.g. "When the developer").  
* No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being 
  harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact
  us with a capture (log, photo, email) of the harassment if possible. 

## Getting help

When you get a question, please find the answers from the follow resources firstly.

Documents, releases, marketing information are on [Dev blog](http://blog.ebookchain.org)

Community discussion, questions, and informal bug reporting are done on the
[forum of Ebookchain](http://forum.ebookchain.org).

## Submitting bug reports

Before reporting a bug, read these pointers.

**Note:** The issue tracker is for *bugs*, not requests for help. Questions
should be asked on the
[forum of Ebookchain](http://forum.ebookchain.org) instead.

When opening new issues or commenting on existing issues on Ebookchain
please make sure discussions are related to concrete technical issues with the
Ebookchain software.

The preferred way to report bugs is to use the
GitHub issue tracker, for example, [Ebookcoin issue tracker](https://github.com/Ebookcoin/ebookcoin/issues) , [Official site of Ebookchain](https://github.com/Ebookchain/ebookchain.org/issues). 

#### Reporting bugs effectively

- Include information about **the browser and the operating system in which 
  the problem occurred**. 

- Mention which release of Ebookchain you're using. Preferably, try also with
  the current development snapshot, to ensure the problem has not already been
  fixed.

- Mention very precisely what went wrong. "X is broken" is not a good bug
  report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Describe the
  exact steps a maintainer has to take to make the problem occur. We can not
  fix something that we can not observe.

- If the problem can not be reproduced in any of the demos included in the
  Ebookchain distribution, please provide an HTML document that demonstrates
  the problem.
